"Explore the intersection of technology and agriculture in my final year B.Tech projectâ€”Corn Leaves Disease Detection using  Deep Learning, I aim to revolutionize crop health monitoring for sustainable farming practices.  #BtechProject #DeepLearning #AgricultureTech"

# CropDisease
This is a complete webapp that uses Flask microframework for plant disease detection.
This repository aims to detect diseases that occur on the maize plants using Convolutional Neural Network. the model is able to predict major 3 diseases that occur on the leaves of the plant which are Corn grey leaf spot, Northern corn leaf blight, and Common Rust. The model is also able to predict healthily plant also.<br>

## Traning
Here we use a pre-trained VGG16 network for our disease classification problem. Then this pre-trained VGG16 was trained on our custom dataset. Our dataset mainly consists the images from [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease). Additional images were scraped from google and manual preprocessing was applied to it before adding it to the original dataset.

  
This code was developed on : 
```
